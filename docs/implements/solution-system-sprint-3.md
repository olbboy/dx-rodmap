# Sprint 3: Post Management System Implementation

## Introduction

This document outlines the technical implementation details for Sprint 3 of the roadmap application, focusing on Post Management. The implementation covers all the CRUD operations for features, status management, tagging system, assignee management, and filtering functionality.

## Database Schema Implementation

### Features Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE features (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  roadmap_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES roadmaps(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status_id UUID REFERENCES statuses(id),
  assignee_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  start_date DATE,
  due_date DATE,
  order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  
  CONSTRAINT fk_roadmap
    FOREIGN KEY(roadmap_id) 
    REFERENCES roadmaps(id) 
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Statuses Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE statuses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL,
  roadmap_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES roadmaps(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  
  CONSTRAINT fk_roadmap
    FOREIGN KEY(roadmap_id) 
    REFERENCES roadmaps(id) 
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Tags Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE tags (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL,
  roadmap_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES roadmaps(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  
  CONSTRAINT fk_roadmap
    FOREIGN KEY(roadmap_id) 
    REFERENCES roadmaps(id) 
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Feature-Tags Junction Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE feature_tags (
  feature_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES features(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tag_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY (feature_id, tag_id)
);
```

## Server Action Implementation

The server actions implement the business logic and handle database operations for the post management system.

### Feature Management Actions

- `createFeature`: Creates a new feature and associates it with selected tags
- `updateFeature`: Updates an existing feature including its tag associations
- `deleteFeature`: Removes a feature and its associated tags
- `updateFeatureStatus`: Updates the status of a feature and its order in the status column

### Status Management Actions

- `createStatus`: Creates a custom status with name and color
- `updateStatus`: Updates an existing status
- `deleteStatus`: Removes a status if no features are associated with it
- `reorderStatuses`: Rearranges the order of statuses

### Tag Management Actions

- `createTag`: Creates a custom tag with name and color
- `updateTag`: Updates an existing tag
- `deleteTag`: Removes a tag and its associations with features

## UI Components Implementation

### Feature Management Components

- `FeatureForm`: Form for creating and editing features with status, assignee, and tag selection
- `FeatureList`: Displays features with filtering capabilities by text, status, and tags
- `DeleteFeatureButton`: Confirmation dialog for feature deletion

### Tag Management Components

- `TagFormDialog`: Dialog for creating and editing tags with color selection

### Status Management Components

- `StatusFormDialog`: Dialog for creating and editing statuses with color selection

## Pages Implementation

- `app/roadmaps/[id]/features/new/page.tsx`: Page for creating new features
- `app/roadmaps/[id]/settings/page.tsx`: Settings page for managing statuses and tags

## Authentication and Authorization

All server actions include authentication checks and verify user permissions:
1. Verify the user is authenticated
2. Check if the user has permission to perform the operation (roadmap ownership)
3. Perform the requested operation only if authorized

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Input validation before database operations
- Database error handling with informative error messages
- Toast notifications for success and error states
- Loading states for better UX during async operations

## Routing and Navigation

The implementation uses Next.js App Router for routing:
- Deep linking to feature creation forms
- Settings page for managing tags and statuses
- Dynamic routing for roadmap-specific features

## Data Flow

1. Server components fetch initial data from Supabase
2. Form components manage client-side state for inputs
3. Server actions perform database operations
4. Route is refreshed to reflect changes

## Performance Considerations

- Server components for initial data fetching
- Client components for interactive elements
- Form validation on both client and server sides
- Selective route revalidation for optimal performance

## Future Enhancements

- Drag and drop for feature reordering
- Batch operations for features
- Advanced filtering options
- Feature dependencies
