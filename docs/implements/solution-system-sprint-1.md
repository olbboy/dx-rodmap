# Sprint 1: Project Setup & Authentication

## System Architecture Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Sprint 1, focusing on project setup and authentication. We'll be following the architectural decisions outlined in the development plan while implementing the core foundation of the application.

### Core Components

1. **Next.js App Router Structure**
   - Implement the folder structure as defined in the plan
   - Configure Next.js with proper settings for App Router
   - Set up TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Implement database tables according to schema
   - Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Set up authentication hooks and utilities

3. **Authentication System**
   - Implement sign in, sign up, and password reset flows
   - Create protected routes with middleware
   - Develop user profile management

4. **UI Component System**
   - Implement base UI components from design system
   - Configure Tailwind CSS with design tokens
   - Create layout components

## Implementation Details

### 1. Project Setup

#### Next.js Configuration
- Update `next.config.ts` to enable experimental features
- Configure environment variables for Supabase
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration

#### Tailwind CSS Setup
- Configure Tailwind with design tokens from design system
- Set up color palette, typography, and spacing
- Create utility classes for common patterns

### 2. Supabase Integration

#### Database Setup
- Create tables for users, roadmaps, roadmap_members
- Implement RLS policies for data access
- Set up authentication tables and triggers

#### Supabase Client
- Create a Supabase client utility
- Implement typed database queries
- Set up authentication hooks

### 3. Authentication System

#### Auth Components
- Create SignIn component
- Create SignUp component
- Create PasswordReset component
- Implement email verification flow

#### Auth Middleware
- Create middleware for route protection
- Implement role-based access control
- Set up authentication state management

#### User Profile
- Create user profile page
- Implement profile editing functionality
- Add avatar upload with Supabase storage

### 4. UI Component System

#### Base Components
- Implement Button component with variants
- Create Input, Select, and Textarea components
- Implement Form components with validation
- Create Card, Dialog, and Modal components

#### Layout Components
- Create AppShell component
- Implement Sidebar component
- Create Header component
- Implement responsive layout system

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement proper code splitting
- Use React Server Components where appropriate
- Optimize authentication flows for speed

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use secure authentication practices
- Sanitize user inputs

### Accessibility
- Ensure all components are accessible
- Implement proper keyboard navigation
- Add ARIA attributes where needed

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- E2E tests for critical paths

## Deliverables

By the end of Sprint 1, we will have:

1. A fully configured Next.js project with proper TypeScript setup
2. A Supabase project with initial tables and RLS policies
3. A functioning authentication system with sign in, sign up, and password reset
4. A set of base UI components implementing the design system
5. A responsive layout system with sidebar and header
6. Route protection middleware for authenticated routes
7. User profile management functionality

## Next Steps

After completing Sprint 1, we will move on to Sprint 2, which focuses on roadmap management. This will build upon the authentication system and UI components created in Sprint 1.
