# Sprint 5: Timeline Visualization System Implementation

## Introduction

This document details the technical implementation approach for the timeline/Gantt visualization component of the roadmap application as part of Sprint 5. This implementation builds upon the existing post management and visualization components from previous sprints.

## System Architecture Changes

### New Components

We will introduce the following new component directories:

```
/components/timeline/     # Core timeline components
/components/milestone/    # Milestone-specific components
/components/dependency/   # Dependency visualization and management
```

### New Routes

We will add the following routes:

```
/app/roadmaps/[id]/timeline/     # Main timeline view
```

### Database Schema Extensions

Two new tables will be added to the database schema:

1. `milestones` - For tracking important project milestones
2. `dependencies` - For tracking relationships between posts

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components and Features

- ✅ Basic types for Milestone and Dependency
- ✅ Server actions for milestone management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Server actions for dependency management
- ✅ Timeline page component
- ✅ MilestoneForm component for creating and editing milestones
- ✅ DeleteMilestoneButton component
- ✅ Context menu component for UI interactions

- ✅ TimelineDependency component for dependency visualization
- ✅ Integration of all components in TimelineView
- ✅ DependencyCreator for creating dependencies between posts
- ✅ DeleteDependencyButton for removing dependencies
- ✅ DependencyList component for listing dependencies
- ✅ API integration for timeline updates

### All Sprint 5 Features Completed

✅ All sprint 5 components and features have been successfully implemented.

### Next Steps for Sprint 6

1. Enhance timeline with additional features (filtering, grouping)
2. Improve performance optimizations for large datasets
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Create documentation and user guides

## Supabase Implementation

### Schema Updates

```typescript
// lib/supabase/schema.ts additions

// Create milestones table
await supabase.rpc('create_milestones_table');

// Create dependencies table
await supabase.rpc('create_dependencies_table');

// Row-level security policies for milestones
await supabase
  .from('milestones')
  .update({ policy: 'roadmap_team_access' })
  .eq('table', 'milestones');

// Row-level security policies for dependencies
await supabase
  .from('dependencies')
  .update({ policy: 'roadmap_team_access' })
  .eq('table', 'dependencies');
```

### Server API Implementation

We've implemented the following server actions:

1. Milestone CRUD operations
2. Dependency management operations
3. Timeline-specific query operations

## Component Implementation Plan

### Core Timeline Components

1. **TimelineView** - The main client component that orchestrates the timeline
2. **TimelineGrid** - Renders the time-based grid with appropriate scaling
3. **TimelineItem** - Renders a post as a timeline item with proper duration
4. **TimelineMilestone** - Renders milestone markers on the timeline
5. **TimelineDependency** - Renders dependency connections between items
6. **TimelineControls** - UI for controlling zoom level and viewport

### Milestone Components

1. **MilestoneForm** - Form for creating and editing milestones
2. **MilestoneList** - Component to view and manage all milestones
3. **DeleteMilestoneButton** - Button to delete milestones with confirmation

### Dependency Components

1. **DependencyCreator** - Interface for creating dependencies between posts
2. **DependencyList** - Component to view and manage all dependencies
3. **DeleteDependencyButton** - Button to delete dependencies with confirmation

## Implementation Approach

### Timeline Visualization Strategy

We will use a custom SVG-based implementation for the timeline visualization:

1. Calculate appropriate time scales based on post durations
2. Render posts as rectangles with width proportional to duration
3. Use SVG lines and paths to represent dependencies
4. Implement milestone markers as distinct visual elements
5. Create a virtualized grid for efficient rendering of large timelines

### State Management

The timeline will manage several key states:

1. **Viewport state** - Controls visible portion of the timeline
2. **Zoom level** - Controls time scale density
3. **Drag state** - Tracks user interactions for panning
4. **Selection state** - Tracks selected posts for dependency creation

### Dependency Visualization

Dependencies will be visualized as SVG paths connecting posts:

1. Calculate start and end points based on post positions
2. Generate appropriate path curves based on dependency type
3. Handle different dependency types with distinct visual styles
4. Implement collision detection to avoid overlapping paths

### Data Fetching Strategy

We will implement efficient data fetching for the timeline:

1. Initial load of posts with date ranges
2. Lazy loading of dependencies as viewport changes
3. Batched updates for dependency modifications
4. Optimistic UI updates with server validation

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Unit Tests

1. Test time scaling calculations
2. Test dependency path generation
3. Test circular dependency detection

### Integration Tests

1. Test viewport manipulation
2. Test milestone creation and visualization
3. Test dependency creation between posts

### End-to-End Tests

1. Test full timeline loading and interaction
2. Test dependency creation workflow
3. Test mobile responsiveness

## Performance Optimization

1. Implement virtualized rendering for posts
2. Use efficient SVG rendering with clipping for dependencies
3. Implement request batching and caching
4. Optimize viewport calculations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Timeline Layout

1. Implement basic timeline grid
2. Create post visualization on timeline
3. Add basic viewport navigation

### Phase 2: Milestone Management

1. Create milestone database tables
2. Implement milestone form and CRUD operations
3. Add milestone visualization on timeline

### Phase 3: Dependency Management

1. Create dependency database tables
2. Implement dependency creation interface
3. Add dependency visualization on timeline

### Phase 4: Refinement and Optimization

1. Optimize performance for large datasets
2. Improve mobile responsiveness
3. Enhance accessibility features
4. Add comprehensive error handling

## Mobile Considerations

The timeline view presents unique challenges on mobile devices:

1. Implement a simplified timeline view for narrow screens
2. Create touch-friendly controls for navigation
3. Provide an alternative list view for very small devices
4. Optimize SVG rendering for mobile performance

## Accessibility Implementation

We will ensure the timeline is accessible to all users:

1. Add keyboard navigation for timeline items
2. Implement ARIA attributes for SVG elements
3. Provide text alternatives for visual relationships
4. Ensure sufficient color contrast for dependency lines
