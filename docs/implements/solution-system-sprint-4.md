# Sprint 4: Kanban View Implementation Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for Sprint 4 of the roadmap application, focusing on the Kanban board visualization. The implementation will leverage the existing feature and status management capabilities from Sprint 3 to create an interactive, drag-and-drop Kanban interface.

## Technical Implementation Overview

The Kanban board visualization requires several interconnected components:

1. A board layout component that organizes features by status
2. Drag-and-drop functionality between status columns
3. Interactive feature cards that display relevant information
4. Server actions to update feature status and order when dragged
5. Filtering capabilities within the board view

## Component Architecture

### Kanban Board Layout

```tsx
// app/roadmaps/[id]/kanban/page.tsx
export default async function KanbanBoardPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Fetch roadmap, features, statuses, and permissions
  // Server component for initial data loading
  return <KanbanBoard roadmapId={params.id} initialFeatures={features} statuses={statuses} isOwner={isOwner} />;
}
```

```tsx
// components/kanban/kanban-board.tsx
"use client";
// Client component for interactive Kanban experience
// Uses DnD libraries and manages board state
```

### Column Architecture

```tsx
// components/kanban/kanban-column.tsx
// Represents a status column in the Kanban board
// Manages feature cards within a single status
// Handles drop targets and column-specific actions
```

### Card Architecture

```tsx
// components/kanban/kanban-card.tsx
// Represents a feature card in the Kanban board
// Shows feature details in a compact format
// Handles drag source functionality
```

## Database Requirements

No new tables are required for Sprint 4, but we will utilize:

1. The `features` table with its `status_id` and `order` fields to track position
2. The `statuses` table to define the columns of the Kanban board

## Server Actions for Kanban

We will add new server actions for Kanban-specific operations:

```typescript
// lib/actions/feature.ts

/**
 * Update a feature's status and order when dragged in Kanban board
 */
export async function updateFeatureStatusAndOrder(
  featureId: string,
  statusId: string,
  newOrder: number
): Promise<Feature | null> {
  // Validate permissions
  // Update the feature's status and order
  // Optionally reorder other features in the same status
  // Return updated feature
}

/**
 * Reorder features within a status column
 */
export async function reorderFeaturesInStatus(
  statusId: string,
  newOrderMap: Record<string, number>
): Promise<boolean> {
  // Update the order of multiple features within a status
  // This enables batch updates when reordering several cards
}
```

## Drag and Drop Implementation

We will use the `@dnd-kit` library for drag-and-drop functionality:

```tsx
// components/kanban/kanban-board.tsx
import {
  DndContext,
  closestCorners,
  KeyboardSensor,
  PointerSensor,
  useSensor,
  useSensors,
} from "@dnd-kit/core";

// Implement DndContext to manage drag and drop across columns
// Handle drag end events to update feature status and order
```

## Filtering and View Settings

```tsx
// components/kanban/kanban-filter.tsx
// Filter controls specifically for the Kanban view
// Allow filtering by tags, assignees, date range, etc.
// Use URL search params for shareable filters
```

## Performance Considerations

To ensure the Kanban board performs well with large datasets:

1. Implement virtualization for columns with many cards
2. Use optimistic UI updates for drag-and-drop operations
3. Batch update requests when reordering multiple cards
4. Implement debouncing for filter operations

## Error Handling

Specific error handling for Kanban operations:

1. Handle network failures during drag-and-drop operations
2. Provide fallback UIs for disconnected state
3. Show appropriate loading states during operations
4. Implement retry mechanisms for failed updates

## Mobile Responsiveness

The Kanban view requires special consideration for mobile:

1. Horizontal scrolling for columns on smaller screens
2. Collapse/expand functionality for columns
3. Touch-friendly drag handles for cards
4. Simplified card view for smaller screens

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for drag-and-drop behavior
2. Integration tests for status updates
3. Performance tests with large datasets
4. Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation

## Implementation Milestones

1. Basic Kanban layout with static columns
2. Feature card implementation with all data
3. Drag-and-drop functionality between columns
4. Server actions for updating feature status and order
5. Filtering and board settings
6. Performance optimizations and testing
7. Mobile responsiveness

## Deployment Considerations

1. Feature flags to control Kanban availability
2. Monitoring for performance bottlenecks
3. Analytics to track Kanban usage patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. Column width customization
2. Card templates and custom fields
3. Swimlanes for grouping cards horizontally
4. Board presets and saved views
